      <p>HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language." It is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. HTML is used to define the structure and presentation of web pages, including text, images, links, forms, and other elements. It provides a way to describe the layout and semantics of a web document, allowing browsers to render the content appropriately for users.</p>
